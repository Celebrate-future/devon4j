= Full Text Search

ATTENTION: You are on the `develop` branch.
This has been renamed to `master`.
The `develop` branch will not be maintained anymore.
It is only left here to avoid broken links to existing content.
Please update links to point to the `master` branch.
For details look at issue https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/issues/320[#320].

If you want to all your users fast and simple searches with just a single search field (like in google), you need full text indexing and search support.
